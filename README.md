# BRAWL GAMENIGHT
## Description:
  Remember back in the late 90's up till the early 20's, I can still remember the best thing about that time which was LAN parties, everyone would bring there consoles to someones house and a pack of Doritos and some Mountain Dew(project NOT sponsered by Doritos/Mountain Dew), those were the days, some people would screen watch (Jerry Wringlefield). One of the best games we played was Super Smash Bros. Brawl (2008) (still having LAN parties as I couldn't afford XBOX live), it was a huge game, even now in 2021 Championship was a prize pool of $150,000.  The only thing we could not decide on at the time was who was the best Character, well no fear today we have populated a database that shows some of the characters and there attributes, as well as having the possibility to add a beloved character that was never  given the chance!!!
